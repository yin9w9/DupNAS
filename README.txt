## 📝 Overview

This project develops DupNAS, a framework that integrates neural architecture search and multi-branch tensor splitting to find high-accuracy networks that are deployable on severely memory-constrained tiny MCU-class devices. To enable this integration, DupNAS shrinks the vast splitting configuration space of multi-branch networks into a smaller set of memory-optimized configurations and explores them in a lightweight manner to resolve memory bottlenecks.


DupNAS is implemented in PyTorch on top of the popular [TinyNAS](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/mcunet) framework for MCUs, with extensions to support multi-branch networks and integration with our splitting strategy. The resulting network solutions are deployed on two microcontroller platforms: the [STM32F746](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html), featuring a 216 MHz ARM Cortex-M7 CPU, 320 KB of VM, and 1 MB of NVM; and the [STM32H747](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32h747i-disco.html), featuring a 400 MHz ARM Cortex-M7/M4 CPU, 512 KB of VM, and 1 MB of NVM. Deployment is evaluated using both the TensorFlow Lite Micro (TFLite Micro) and STM32Cube.AI inference engines.
We evaluate DupNAS on three vision-based TinyML network families, namely MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and InceptionV3, under different memory constraints. All networks are trained on the ImageNet-100 dataset. DupNAS is compared against two existing splitting strategies, TinyTS and PatchTS.

### 🔧 Setup and running DupNAS

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Create and activate a Python environment, then install the required dependencies.
   ```python
   python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure access to the ImageNet-100 dataset
   * Open the [ImageNet-100 Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambityga/imagenet100).
   * Generate a Kaggle API token.
   * Export the token:
     ```bash
     export KAGGLE_API_TOKEN="<your-token>"
     ```
   * Store the token in the Kaggle configuration directory:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
     echo "<your-token>" > ~/.kaggle/access_token
     chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/access_token
     ```
   The dataset is downloaded and prepared automatically when DupNAS is run for the first time stage 2.
4. Copy the configuration file for the target architecture and run DupNAS:
   ```bash
   cd DupNAS/
   cp settings/settings-<arc>.py settings.py

   python3.9 -m NASBase.run_nas \
     --stages <stage> \
     --arc <arc> \
     --dataset IMAGE100 \
     --mode <mode> \
     --vmsize <vmsize> \
     --suffix <suffix> \
     --no-rlogger
   ```
  
  📝 Arguments
  | Options | Description | Candidate Values |
  |---|---|---|
  | `--stages` | Number of NAS stages: ssopt, training, evosearch, fine-tuning | `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` |
  | `--arc` | network architecture family | `mbv2`, `shuffle`, `incept` |
  | `--dataset` | Dataset used for search | `IMAGE100` |
  | `--mode` | splitting strategy  | `dupnas`, `tinyts`, `patchts`, `nots` | 
  | `--vmsize` | VM constraint in KB | `96`, `128`, `256` |
  | `--suffix` | Experiment suffix for naming outputs. Use the same suffix for all four stages. | user-defined string |
  
5. After completing Stages 1–4, extract the selected network configuration, the final solution is saved in `/DupNAS/NASBase/train_log/<suffix>_best_solution.json`
6. ONNX generation and tensor-splitting conversion are integrated into the model-converter workflow. Continue with steps in the next section.


### ✂️ Setup and running the model converter
1. Copy the configurations `"supernet config"` and `"subnet_choice_per_blk"` from: `<suffix>_best_solution.json`, into: `/DupNAS/NASBase/spec_model_<arc>.txt`.
2. Go to `/DupNAS/`, then run the corresponding script to generate the selected ONNX models: 
   ```bash
   bash gen_selected_shuffle.sh
   bash gen_selected_mbv2.sh
   bash gen_selected_incept.sh
   ```
3. The generated models are saved in the following locations:
   * Original selected ONNX models: `/DupNAS/genonnx/<arc>/`
   * Tensor-split ONNX models: `/Inference/Model-converter/ts_converted/<arc>/`
4. Go to the `/Inference/onnx-to-tflite/` directory and run the corresponding conversion command:
   ```bash
   bash convert.sh shuffle
   bash convert.sh mbv2
   bash convert.sh incept
   ```
   The conversion uses [onnx2tf](https://github.com/PINTO0309/onnx2tf) to generate integer-quantized TensorFlow Lite models, such as:
   ```text
   xxx_full_integer_quant.tflite
   ```
   The generated TFLite models are saved under `/Inference/onnx-to-tflite/outputs/`
   
### ⚙️ Setup and building TFLite-Micro

1. Copy the converted TFLite model (`xxx_full_integer_quant.tflite`) into `Tflm-engine/src/models`.
2. Follow [Tflm-engine/README.md](Inference/Tflm-engine/README.md) to build the TFLite-Micro static library (`libtensorflow-microlite.a`).
3. Add the generated static library to your STM32CubeIDE project settings. Then include `Tflm-engine/src/tflm_main.h` and call `tflm_main_xxx` to run inference for the target model.

For more information, please refer to [Tflm-engine/README.md](Inference/Tflm-engine/README.md).
