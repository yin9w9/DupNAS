## 📝 Overview
---

DupNAS is a framework for improving neural network accuracy under tight memory constraints on resource-constrained devices. It combines neural architecture search with multi-branch tensor splitting to reduce peak memory usage and make larger or more accurate networks deployable on small devices.

To address the peak memory challenge, DupNAS greatly shrinks the configuration space and incrementally explores only the configurations that can remove memory bottlenecks with low latency overhead.

We build DupNAS by integrating our multi-branch splitting method into TinyNAS for microcontrollers. We evaluate it on several vision-based TinyML network families under different memory budgets, and also deploy the searched networks on an STM32 microcontroller.

DupNAS is implemented in PyTorch and developed on a server with an Intel Xeon E5-2678 CPU (2.5GHz), 128 GB RAM, and four NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPUs. The split-network solutions are INT8-quantized and deployed on an STM32F746 MCU with an ARM Cortex-M7 CPU 216 MHz), 320 KB VM, and 1 MB NVM, running the TFLite Micro inference engine. We also extend the TFLite Micro model converter to avoid extra NVM usage caused by duplicated weights when converting split networks from PyTorch to the deployment format.

We evaluate DupNAS on three backbone network families—MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and InceptionV3—trained on the ImageNet-100 dataset. We compare DupNAS with two existing splitting methods, TinyTS and PatchTS.

### 🔧Setup and Build for DupNAS

1. Download/clone this repository
2. Create and activate a Python environment, and install dependencies
3. Prepare the ImageNet-100 dataset and update dataset paths.
4. Run the NAS pipeline:
  ```python
  python3.9 -m NASBase.run_nas --stages <stage> --arc <arc> --dataset IMAGE100 --mode <mode> --vmsize <vmsize> --suffix <suffix> --no-rlogger
  ```
  
  ### 📝 NAS Command Arguments

5. catch the solution to fill `spec_model.txt`
6. generate the onnx for solution networks by `\TiNAS\NASBase\spec_onnx_gen.py`

### ✂️ Model Splitting


### ⚙️ Inference

To deploy models with [TensorFlow Lite Micro](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro) on STM32, follow the steps below:

1. Convert the ONNX models to TFLite with [onnx2tf](https://github.com/PINTO0309/onnx2tf). One convenient option is to use the official Docker image:
   ```bash
   run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workdir -w /workdir ghcr.io/pinto0309/onnx2tf:1.28.5  
   onnx2tf -i ONNX_MODEL -oiqt
   ```
   This produces fully integer-quantized TFLite models such as `xxx_full_integer_quant.tflite`.

2. Copy the converted TFLite model (`xxx_full_integer_quant.tflite`) into `tflm-template/src/models`.

3. Follow [tflm-template/README.md](tflm-template/README.md) to build the TensorFlow Lite Micro static library (`libtensorflow-microlite.a`).

4. Add the generated static library to your STM32CubeIDE project settings. Then include `tflm-template/src/tflm_main.h` and call `tflm_main_xxx` to run inference for the target model.

For more information, please refer to [tflm-template/README.md](tflm-template/README.md).
