## 📝 Overview

DupNAS is a framework for improving neural network accuracy under tight memory constraints on resource-constrained devices. It combines neural architecture search with multi-branch tensor splitting to reduce peak memory usage, enabling larger or more accurate networks to be deployed on small devices.

DupNAS is evaluated on three vision-based TinyML backbone families, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and InceptionV3, under different memory budgets. All networks are trained on the ImageNet-100 dataset. We compare DupNAS with TinyTS and PatchTS, and deploy the searched networks on an STM32 microcontroller.

DupNAS is implemented in PyTorch and developed on a server with an Intel Xeon E5-2678 CPU (2.5 GHz), 128 GB RAM, and four NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPUs. The split-network solutions are INT8-quantized and deployed on an STM32F746 MCU with an ARM Cortex-M7 CPU 216 MHz), 320 KB VM, and 1 MB NVM, running the TFLite Micro inference engine.

## 🧭 Getting Started


### 💡 Requirement

- `Python 3.9` is recommended.
- Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` with:
  `python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install/overview) is optional, but recommended for managing Python environments.
- The main dataset used in this project is [ImageNet-100](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambityga/imagenet100/data). You can prepare and load it using: `/DupNAS/NASBase/load_image100.py`.
- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
- [STM32F746NG MCU](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html)
- [TensorFlow Lite Micro](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro)

### 🔧Setup and Build for DupNAS

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Create and activate a Python environment, then install the required dependencies.
3. Prepare the ImageNet-100 dataset and update the dataset paths.
4. Run the NAS pipeline:
  ```python
  python3.9 -m NASBase.run_nas --stages <stage> --arc <arc> --dataset IMAGE100 --mode <mode> --vmsize <vmsize> --suffix <suffix> --no-rlogger
  ```
  
  📝 Arguments
  | Option | Description | Candidate Values |
  |---|---|---|
  | `--stages` | Number of NAS stages: ssopt, training, evosearch, fine-tuning | `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` |
  | `--arc` | Backbone architecture | `mbv2`, `shuffle`, `incept` |
  | `--dataset` | Dataset used for search | `IMAGE100` |
  | `--mode` | TS optimization  | `dupnas`, `tinyts`, `patchts`, `nots` | 
  | `--vmsize` | VM constraint in KB | `96`, `128`, `256` |
  | `--suffix` | Experiment suffix for output naming | user-defined string |
  
5. Extract the solution from `best_solution,json` and use it to fill in `spec_model.txt`
6. Generate the ONNX models for the selected solution using `/DupNAS/NASBase/spec_onnx_gen.py`. The outputs will be saved in `/DupNAS/genonnx/`.
7. Go to `/DupNAS/genonnx/`, then run `python3.9 -m DupNAS_SA.py --onnx <onnx_name> --mode <mode> --vmsize <vmsize> --export_file` to generate the TS configuration. Alternatively, you can run `run_all_onnx.sh` to automatically generate TS configurations for all ONNX models in the directory.
8. Run `gen_ts_cfg.py` to collect the `split-configuration JSON file` for Model-converter


### ✂️ Model-converter

1. Copy the ONNX model and its corresponding split-configuration JSON file from `/DupNAS/genonnx/` to `/Inference/Model-converter/`
2. Split the model by [ONNX Tensor Splitter](Inference/Model-converter/README.md).
3. Convert the ONNX models to TFLite with [onnx2tf](https://github.com/PINTO0309/onnx2tf). One convenient option is to use the official Docker image:
   ```bash
   run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workdir -w /workdir ghcr.io/pinto0309/onnx2tf:1.28.5  
   onnx2tf -i ONNX_MODEL -oiqt
   ```
   This produces fully integer-quantized TFLite models such as `xxx_full_integer_quant.tflite`.

### ⚙️ Tflm-engine

1. Copy the converted TFLite model (`xxx_full_integer_quant.tflite`) into `Tflm-engine/src/models`.
2. Follow [Tflm-engine/README.md](Inference/Tflm-engine/README.md) to build the TensorFlow Lite Micro static library (`libtensorflow-microlite.a`).
3. Add the generated static library to your STM32CubeIDE project settings. Then include `Tflm-engine/src/tflm_main.h` and call `tflm_main_xxx` to run inference for the target model.

For more information, please refer to [Tflm-engine/README.md](Inference/Tflm-engine/README.md).


<!-- sudo docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workdir -w /workdir ghcr.io/pinto0309/onnx2tf:1.28.5   -->
